# wslvb

I like to run eve-ng or gns3 for network testing and WSL does not work at all with these. BUT i really like WSL or at least the idea behind it SO i decided to use virtualbox headless mode to accomplish the same thing. I actually ended with a little better functionality because I added a host network connection which is not an option with WSL. 

I wrote it in python because I want to learn the language better.

this also assumes both python and vboxmanage commands are in you windows env path.
